    <h1>Welcome to the future of education. Your education.</h1> 
    A few years ago, Georgia Gwinnett College was home to just over 100 students. Let's just say things have changed. What was once 260 acres of rolling terrain has become the perfect metropolitan college campus of 12,000 students.
    <p>     <b> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What's so perfect about it?</b> GGC adapts to how you do things--your learning style, your work schedule, and your life.</p>
    <br>From the ground up, GGC was designed to help you <u>succeed</u>. That's <mark>game changing</mark> .
